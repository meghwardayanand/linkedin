# LinkedIn Project

This is the clone of LinkedIn social media platform. I gave it the name **"MyNetwork"** instead of **"LinkedIn"** where I am trying to utilize my basic website development skills. I am trying to use the basic concepts of `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `Core PHP` in this project.

Steps to run the project:
1. Install PHP (v8.4.2)
2. Execute Project with command `php -S localhost:8000`
